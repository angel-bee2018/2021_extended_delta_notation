Here is how the HGNC stable variant IDs are created:

*Ensembl transcripts*

Create discrete gene trees to combat the many-to-many relationship between ENSG IDs and HGNC gene symbols. 
ENSG IDs are considered to be part of the same gene tree if: 
  - at some point they had the same HGNC gene symol in the same release.
HGNC gene symbols are considered to belong to the same gene tree if:
  - they are linked through the same ENSG ID through different releases. 

We assign a unique ID to each gene tree. For each gene tree, the *order* in which ENSG IDs are historically folded into each tree is thus invariant.
