Here is how the HGNC stable variant IDs are created/generated:

*Ensembl transcripts*

Create discrete gene trees to combat the many-to-many relationship between ENSG IDs and HGNC gene symbols. 
ENSG IDs are considered to be part of the same gene tree if: 
  - at some point they had the same HGNC gene symol in the same release.
HGNC gene symbols are considered to belong to the same gene tree if:
  - they are linked through the same ENSG ID through different releases. 

We assign a unique ID to each gene tree. For each gene tree, the *order* in which ENSG IDs are historically folded into each tree is thus invariant.
These "nexus" points are defined as the first release in which an ENSG ID possessed a common HGNC gene symbol in the same release. 
We thus number the historical ENSG folding order starting from 1. This the number, when not equal to 1, will be placed between hyphen and "enst".

For transcript variant numbers, we subset each gene tree.
For genes such as mitochondrial tRNA, different ENST IDs can have their own gene name, despite being from the same ENSG ID.
Therefore, for each combination of ENSG + ENST ID + their versions, we find their gene name in the latest release. 
This will be the HGNC gene symbol used. 
After that, we create the stable variant number *FOR EACH ENSG ID SEPARATELY*. IMPORTANT. This is because now ENST IDs are ALWAYS the highest for each *ENSG ID*, but there is nothing stopping unrelated ENSG IDs from being folded into the same gene tree, which jams a bunch of ENST IDs into the middle of the existing ENST ID roster of the gene tree. I can confirm that this HAS happened before and will happen again. 
The transcript version is simply tacked on after the fact.

e.g. RUNX2-2enst1.7

*Uniprot proteins*

# In order to remain agnostic due to the current independence of the proteomics and transcriptomics communities, we must cater for BOTH RNA and protein-centric naming in order to achieve best results for standardisation.
# Thus we have two methods to name a protein:
#   1. Gene (dogma)-centric: applicable for multiomics, predicted proteome consequences of RNA splicing and when the originating RNA of a protein product is known.
#   2. Protein-centric: for protein-centric studies such as pure protein splicing, where they currently just draw out protein schematics. 

# GENE-CENTRIC (DOGMA) NAMING - HGNC STABLE PROTEIN ID
1.  Use the *idmapping.dat file from the Uniprot FTP server to map each protein to an ENSG ID
2.  Because this is for generation of EDN only, we then look up the gene tree for the latest HGNC gene symbol associated with the ENSG ID.
