Here is how the HGNC stable variant IDs are created:

*Ensembl transcripts*

Create discrete gene trees to combat the many-to-many relationship between ENSG IDs and HGNC gene symbols. 
ENSG IDs are considered to be part of the same gene tree if: 
  - at some point they had the same HGNC gene symol in the same release.
HGNC gene symbols are considered to belong to the same gene tree if:
  - they are linked through the same ENSG ID through different releases. 

We assign a unique ID to each gene tree. For each gene tree, the *order* in which ENSG IDs are historically folded into each tree is thus invariant.
These "nexus" points are defined as the first release in which an ENSG ID possessed a common HGNC gene symbol in the same release. 
We thus number the historical ENSG folding order starting from 1. This the number, when not equal to 1, will be placed between hyphen and "enst".
